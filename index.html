            <h2>A primer of post intelligent tools age</h2>
  
            <p><b>Between the memes: </b> <br>
I saw two interesting posts on Twitter; one is about unionized "techies." 
protesting in the state of Karnataka, India [1] and another one about some undergrad at MIT getting a seven-figure salary (yes, at least $1 million per year; let that sink in!) [2]. <br>
 
I found it very interesting because employees unionizing for better conditions is an old story. But non-C-suite employees getting paid like IPL cricketers or NFL players is new [3]. There are companies generating millions of dollars of revenue with just a handful of people [4]. This is as laissez-faire as it can probably get. <br>

Value throughput is maximized only because of the software creation, which is made possible by "techies.” If the broader goal of employee unions is to demand better pay and conditions for the workers, one has to wonder: why is there a need for union-driven protest in an industry that is ready to compensate generously? This is precisely the question I had.<br>
<br>
<b>Relationship between industry entities[5]:</b> 

<ul>
<li>Inter-relationships between all the entities in an industry are purely economical. All the entities in the industry contribute as much as they can and engage in a mercantile exchange of contributions.</li>
<li>
Distributed manufacturing and global supply chains assign a specific function to each role. It may be hard for one person to build everything by themselves, but collectively, we can build wonderful things like an internal combustion engine, a pencil[6], etc.</li>
<li>
Hierarchically arranged roles compete with and against each other for rewards and, as a whole, produce something greater and better than what each individual can do by themselves.</li>
</ul> 
<br>

<b>Software and intelligent software: </b>
<br>Software eating the world is an adage at this point [7], but modern software is not just another tool to improve/multiply human productivity. It is an intelligent agent machine that is as good as human agents at performing certain jobs. It is a radically new technological development. When software became intelligent, it upended the relationships between the fundamental entities in an industry. 
 <br><br>

<b>Race to the bottom: </b>
<br>Where there once was a capital exchange for services provided by humans, there is now a subscription fee for the services offered by the software agent, and those services are only going to get cheaper and better. The hierarchies of the human agent are now the same as the features offered by a software agent, and software agents allow pro-rata rewards like no other.

<br>Software chipped away and devoured everything that came in its way to increase the productivity of the entire industry. The rewards are catered only to those who can create something that devours the rest of the industry faster than anything else there is.

<br>What came about was a race to the bottom [8]. When individuals are rewarded for creating something that completely replaces another individual's role, this starts a race to replace as many roles as possible with intelligent software agents. Instead of looking at it as good or bad, I think it should be seen as inevitable. 

<br>This trend is not going to slow down and is probably going to get stronger. Regulating the industry will only shift control from decentralized private entities to one centralized authority, but that does not delay or halt the software from devouring knowledge domains.
 

<br><br><b>Aftermath: </b>
<br>The changes brought by intelligent software, whatever they may be, are going to be new and probably completely different from anything we knew up to this point. I am not an AI-doomer. I am glad to be alive to witness the unveiling of revolutionary technology; here is the question I have been asking my friends: what’s next—how to engage in public discourse(if there is one) which might be uncomfortable and hard but is necessary? ... for the times they are a-changin’!<br><br>
